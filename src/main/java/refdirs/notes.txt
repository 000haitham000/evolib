BUG FIX: 
    A separate epsilon has been added to the reference directions library.
    Adding the new ReferenceDirection.DIR_EPSILON which can be different from
    Mathematics.EPSILON avoids the problems arising in the reference directions
    library because of changing the main precision variable Mathematics.EPSILON.
